  <br> <p> Travelling British linguist hopping across the Channel and exploring… I hope this blog will inspire you to travel to some of the locations and explore the sites which aren't so touristy or over-populated. Read some of my posts to get inspiration for your own trips; be bold, and leave the land of teapots and marmite!

I’m a languages student at the University of Southampton, and enjoy escaping (sorry, that should read ‘exploring’) lectures and getting myself lost in foreign lands.
I’ve travelled a fair bit, and hoping to do a whole lot more.
From September 2015 I spent eleven months working in a Christian school in south-west Germany; getting more familiar with the Dreyeckland and the Schwarzwald was rather exciting!b</p> </br>
