<h1> Norway </h1>
<p> The land of fairytales and fjords, Norway is a stunning country to visit. Whether it is for an extended weekend or a full-blown month, there is plenty to discover. </p>
<p> The capital city, <u>Oslo, </u> is comparatively small when judged alongside other large European cities, but it neatly combines international efficiency with a slightly more rural and relaxed feel. </p>

<p> On the eastern seaboard, the historical and now major scientific city <u>Bergen</u> is becoming more popular as a tourist hotspot (despite the rain…), alongside <u>Kristiansand</u> and <u>Stavanger</u>. </p>

<p> The mountains and sea have sculpted Norway into a beautiful landscape and the weather has shaped the construction of the nation into compact, study communities, taking advantage of every natural windbreak or shelter that the surroundings can offer. Visit the fjords by boat, or take the renowned Rauma railway to Åndalsnes, a small rural town on the shore of the Romdalsfjorden, with the spectacular and formidable Trollsteggen mountain range surrounding it. </p>
