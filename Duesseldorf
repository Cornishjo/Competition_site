<h1> Duesseldorf, Germany </h1>
<p> To be perfectly honest, Düsseldorf isn’t really intended to be the perfect holiday destination, but it is a good place for a winter weekend break. </p>

<p> The city itself is large, the capital of the region, and has undergone fairly extensive regeneration post-war and post-industrial era. Thanks to the bombings, there isn’t a huge amount of old ‘Altstadt’ visible beyond the street layouts and a few rebuilt churches, but the seven individual Weihnachtsmärkte formed a chain which naturally led the tourist and resident through the streets and shopping districts.</p>

<p> Düsseldorf is served internally well by a regular network of trams and the U-bahn, and it is easily reached from the UK. The airport lies half an hour from the city centre, and has connecting flights to London and other regional airports. </p>

<h3> Things to do </h3>

<p> The Rheinturm dominates the skyline and it has a special light clock on the side of it! Quite how useful it actually is remains to be seen; there is an optimal position to stand and count the lights, or they end up merging together.
The restaurant at the top of the Rheinturm has fantastic views across the Ruhrpott; lots of factories, lots of chimneys, and the Rhine cutting a broad and squiggly line through the landscape. </p>

<p> The Mediahafen was described by someone on TripAdvisor as if all the buildings were designed by a drunk architect. It certainly does look a bit bizarre, but it’s interesting to wander around and look at the ships in the port.</p>
